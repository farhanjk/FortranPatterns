FortranPatterns
===============

Implementation of popular design patterns in Fortran. This is intended to facilitate the community using Fortran for computationally expensive tasks. The main philosophy here is to make these patterns available for improving the reusability and efficiency of the code. 

Tested on: GNU Fortran (GCC) 4.8.

#### Creational Patterns
- [X] Abstract Factory
- [X] Builder
- [X] Factory Method
- [X] Prototype
- [X] Singleton

#### Structural Patterns
- [X] Adapter
- [X] Bridge
- [X] Composite
- [X] Criteria
- [X] Decorator
- [ ] Fa√ßade
- [ ] Flyweight
- [ ] Proxy
 
#### Behavioral Patterns
- [ ] Chain of Responsibility
- [ ] Command
- [ ] Interpreter
- [ ] Iterator
- [ ] Mediator
- [ ] Memento
- [X] Observer
- [X] State
